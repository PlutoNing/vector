/// `OrderedAcknowledgements` allows determining when a record is eligible for deletion.
///
/// ### Purpose
///
/// In disk buffers, a record may potentially represent multiple events. As these events
/// may be processed at different times by a sink, and in a potentially different order than when
/// stored in the record, a record cannot be considered fully processed until all of the events have
/// been accounted for.  As well, only once a record has been fully processed can it be considered
/// for deletion to free up space in the buffer.
///
/// To complicate matters, a record may sometimes not be decodable -- on-disk corruption, invalid
/// encoding scheme that is no longer supported, etc -- but still needs to be accounted for to know
/// when it can be deleted, and so that the correct metrics can be generated to determine how many
/// events were lost by the record not being able to be processed normally.
///
/// ### Functionality
///
/// `OrderedAcknowledgements` provides the ability to add "markers", which are a virtual token mapped
/// to a record. Markers track the ID of a record, how long the record is (if known), and optional
/// data that is specific to the record.  It also provides the ability to add acknowledgements which
/// can then be consumed to allow yielding markers which have collected enough acknowledgements and
/// are thus "eligible".
///
/// ### Detecting record gaps and the length of undecodable records
///
/// Additionally, and as hinted at above, markers can be added without a known length: this may
/// happen when a record is read but it cannot be decoded, and thus determining the true length is
/// not possible.
///
/// When markers that have an unknown length are added, `OrderedAcknowledgements` will do one of two things:
/// - figure out if the marker is ahead of the next expected marker ID, and add a synthetic "gap"
///   marker to compensate
/// - update the unknown length with an assumed length, based on the difference between its ID and
///   the ID of the next marker that gets added
///
/// In this way, `OrderedAcknowledgements` provides a contiguous range of marker IDs, which allows
/// detecting not only the presumed length of a record that couldn't be decoded, but also if any
/// records were deleted from disk or unable to be read at all.  Based on the invariant of expecting
/// IDs to be monotonic and contiguous, we know that if we expect our next marker ID to be 5, but
/// instead get one with an ID of 8, that there's 3 missing events in the middle that have not been
/// accounted for.
///
/// Similarly, even when we don't know what the next expected marker ID should be, we can determine
/// the number of events that were lost when the next marker is added, as marker IDs represent the
/// start of a record, and so simple arithmetic can determine the number of events that have
/// theoretically been lost.
