/// The function reads up to `max_size` bytes from `reader`, splitting the input
/// by `delim`. If a `delim` is not found in `reader` before `max_size` bytes
/// are read then the reader is polled until `delim` is found and the results
/// are discarded. Else, the result is written into `buf`.
///
/// The return is unusual. In the Err case this function has not written into
/// `buf` and the caller should not examine its contents. In the Ok case if the
/// inner value is None the caller should retry the call as the buffering read
/// hit the end of the buffer but did not find a `delim` yet, indicating that
/// we've sheered a write or that there were no bytes available in the `reader`
/// and the `reader` was very sure about it. If the inner value is Some the
/// interior `usize` is the number of bytes written into `buf`.
